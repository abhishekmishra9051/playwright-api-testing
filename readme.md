## To set up a project for automating API testing using Playwright and GitHub Actions, you'll need to perform the following steps:

# Project Structure
```
playwright-api-testing/
  |- .github/workflows/
  |    |- test.yml 
  |
  |- api/
  |   |- index.js                    // API server file
  |
  |- tests/
  |   |- api-tests/
  |   |    |- hello-world.test.js    // Playwright API test file
  |   |
  |   |- setup/
  |        |- playwright.config.js   // Playwright setup file
  |
  |- package.json                    //  Manifest file 
```
